# Mastermind in Eiffel #

This is an implementation of the [Mastermind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29 "Wikipedia article on Mastermind") game in Eiffel.

It supports an arbitrary number of colours and pins, and can be played by both humans and computers (the computer's "AI" is alright; it uses an algorithm that's faster than [Knuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29#Five-guess_algorithm "Donald Knuth's Mastermind algorithm")'s, but not as good).

It was originally for a college assignment, but I thought I'd stick it as something that people learning Eiffel could look at; I found very little Eiffel code on the net when I was learning it.
